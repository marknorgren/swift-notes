#### Whitespace

* Prefer indent using **Spaces**
* Tab Width 4 spaces
* Indent Width 4 spaces
* Tab key indents in leading whitespace

_Rationale:_ Xcode defaults.

#### Prefer `let`-bindings over `var`-bindings wherever possible

Use `let foo = …` over `var foo = …` wherever possible (and when in doubt). Only use `var` if you absolutely have to (i.e. you *know* that the value might change, e.g. when using the `weak` storage modifier).

_Rationale:_ The intent and meaning of both keywords is clear, but *let-by-default* results in safer and clearer code.

A `let`-binding guarantees and *clearly signals to the programmer* that its value will never change. Subsequent code can thus make stronger assumptions about its usage.

It becomes easier to reason about code. Had you used `var` while still making the assumption that the value never changed, you would have to manually check that.

Accordingly, whenever you see a `var` identifier being used, assume that it will change and ask yourself why.

### Return and break early

When you have to meet certain criteria to continue execution, try to exit early. So, instead of this:

```swift
if n.isNumber {
    // Use n here
} else {
    return
}
```

use this:
```swift
guard n.isNumber else {
    return
}
// Use n here
```

You can also do it with `if` statement, but using `guard` is prefered, because `guard` statement without `return`, `break` or `continue` produces a compile-time error, so exit is guaranteed.



#### Avoid Using Force-Unwrapping of Optionals

If you have an identifier `foo` of type `FooType?` or `FooType!`, don't force-unwrap it to get to the underlying value (`foo!`) if possible.

Instead, prefer this:

```swift
if let foo = foo {
    // Use unwrapped `foo` value in here
} else {
    // If appropriate, handle the case where the optional is nil
}
```

Alternatively, you might want to use Swift's Optional Chaining in some of these cases, such as:

```swift
// Call the function if `foo` is not nil. If `foo` is nil, ignore we ever tried to make the call
foo?.callSomethingIfFooIsNotNil()
```

_Rationale:_ Explicit `if let`-binding of optionals results in safer code. Force unwrapping is more prone to lead to runtime crashes.

#### Avoid Using Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals

Where possible, use `let foo: FooType?` instead of `let foo: FooType!` if `foo` may be nil (Note that in general, `?` can be used instead of `!`).

_Rationale:_ Explicit optionals result in safer code. Implicitly unwrapped optionals have the potential of crashing at runtime.

#### When specifying a type, always associate the colon with the identifier

When specifying the type of an identifier, always put the colon immediately
after the identifier, followed by a space and then the type name.

```swift
class SmallBatchSustainableFairtrade: Coffee { ... }

let timeToCoffee: NSTimeInterval = 2

func makeCoffee(type: CoffeeType) -> Coffee { ... }
```

_Rationale:_ The type specifier is saying something about the _identifier_ so
it should be positioned with it.

Also, when specifying the type of a dictionary, always put the colon immediately
after the key type, followed by a space and then the value type.

```swift
let capitals: [Country: City] = [ Sweden: Stockholm ]
```
